**Car Search** App was created with Aashi Singh, https://www.github.com/aashisinghh.

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Inspiration

Ever been overwhelmed browsing through multiple sites looking for new or used cars. We decided to make this process easier. All you have to do is put in your criteria and find the best match for the car you are looking for.

## What it does

Given your requirements for any or all of the following: condition, minimum year, model, make, exterior color, city, state, maximum price, category, fuel type, mileage. It finds the best car match that is on sale and outputs the following information: year, make, model, condition, color, mileage, price, the image of the car, and dealership website and location.

## How we built it

We built this program using the vehicle listings API by AutoDev, https://www.auto.dev/listings/getting-started. We used python to store and display the information from the API. We used repl.it to build our program.

## Challenges we ran into

We found it challenging to access and show the image of the car. We used the PIL python program to do this.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

We are proud that we created an interactive program that makes it easier to search for cars online.

## What we learned

We learned how to combine online data from an API to our personal project.

## What's next for **Car Search**

Our vision is to create a website that will seamlessly merge our program into a web browser, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that it creates an even friendlier user interface.
